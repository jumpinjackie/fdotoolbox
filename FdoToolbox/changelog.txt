      see significant gains in performance.
    - New FdoInfo.exe command: ListBcpTasks
    - New "Dump Schema Mapping" command. The only applies to providers that support schema overrides. This command will dump a default 
      XML configuration file, which you can then edit with a text editor and load to override the default schema mappings.

v0.9.5
------

- Enhancements:
    - Full support for side-by-side installations of x86 and x64 versions. This means you 
      can have x86 and x64 versions of this release installed on the same machine and

    - Express connect support for OSGeo.PostgreSQL provider
    - New ForceWKB bulk copy task option.
    - Drag/Drop support for excel documents (*.xls)
    - Streamlined naming convention for new connections.
    - FdoUtil.exe enhancements:
        - Updated command: RunTask

              within a bulk copy definition file instead of all tasks in the file.
        - New command: ExecuteSql
            - Allows a non-SELECT SQL statement to be executed
    - SQL Server output now uses direct SQL INSERT statements as regular FDO insert enforces

    - Fixes for the user coordinate system catalog UI.

v0.9.3
------

- FDO updated to 3.5.0 RC1
- Lazy load schema/class/property nodes. Describe schema won't execute until connection node is expanded for the first time.

v0.9.2
------

- Other:
    - Move schema/class/property attribute editing into the Schema Designer. The context menu commands are removed. Note that not all providers support custom attributes, and that
      there is no current way to detect if custom attributes are supported. For reference, the providers which are known to support custom attributes are: SQL Server and MySQL
    - Data Preview: When adding computed properties, it will now be able to interpret (<expr> as <alias>) expressions and assign the correct alias. Editing a computed property will
      now show (<expr>) AS <alias> in the Expression Editor. If you omit the (AS <alias>) component of an expression it will use a system-generated one (previous behaviour)

- Fixes:
    - Data Preview now works properly in ArcSDE.

v0.9.1
------

- Enhancements:
    - Data Query: Support for deleting/updating multiple selected results in the results grid.

    - Fix RunTask command in FdoUtil.exe where there is a high probability of the wrong data source being deleted if the bulk copy definition has copy tasks where DeleteTarget = true
    - Support for connection names with slashes (\) in them. These connections are persisted as relative paths from the session directory.
    - Data Query: All queries are now done using qualified class names. This should now work on data stores with multiple schemas each containing identically named feature classes.
    - Fix SQL Server saved connections not reloading on next startup.

- Other:
    - Migrate project files to Visual Studio 2008 format. Still targeting .net Framework 2.0 SP1.

v0.9.0
------

- Enhancements:
    - API and Data Preview support for "flattening" geometries. 
        - Previously, previewing spatial data with Z or M ordinates will fail. Now it is possible to preview such spatial data (these are stripped away when previewed).
        - Bulk copy (regular and express) support for geometry flattening.
    - A new Geometry Visualizer dialog to preview FGF geometry text (again, if it has Z or M ordinates, they are stripped away when previewed). This is currently only used in the ExpressionEditor.
    - Support for saving partial schemas. This replaces the save schema as XML/SDF commands.
    - Schemas/Classes/Properties are alphabetically sorted in the Object Explorer.
    - Schema Designer Enhancements

    - The custom gdal16.dll has been removed and replaced with the original one from the FDO SDK. The original motivation for using the official gdal16.dll was to have a more capable OGR provider, but this turned out to have conflicts with the PostGIS provider. If you want a more capable OGR provider, then follow the instructions here (keeping in mind that it may conflict with the PostGIS provider): http://trac.osgeo.org/fdo/wiki/FdoOgrNotes

v0.8.8
------

- Fixes:
    - Improve the .net Framework detection routine in the NSIS installer
    - Oracle provider fixes for Data Query
    - Add missing GDAL dlls as a result of bundling the offical gdal16.dll

v0.8.2
------

- Enhancements:
    - Additional OGR connection builders for: ESRI Shape Files, ESRI ArcCoverage, Microstation DGN V7, GeoJSON, S-57, Atlas BNA, OGR Virtual Dirver and Generic Interface.
    - Data Preview now renders features with random colors, making some datasets much easier to look at. Added a new preference which allows random theming to be enabled/disabled.
    - Can view attributes of selected features in Data Preview (Map Mode).
    - Add a new connection capability viewer. Available on the context menu of a selected connection in the Object Explorer.
    - Expression Editor enhanced to allow fetching of distinct values
    - New button in Schema Designer (contextual mode) allowing the user to fix any incompatiblities in the current schema.

- Other:
    - R-Tree spatial indexing for FdoFeatureTable
    - Changed the file drag/drop zone to be just the Object Explorer.
    - Express Bulk Copy performs extra checks (geometry storage) when the target is a SHP file.
    - API changes to ICapability (to ensure querying of capability types with the correct type), and to support the new capability viewer.
    
v0.8.0
------

- Enhancements:
    - Object Explorer is populated using enhanced IDescribeSchema where possible. This means faster performance for providers that support it (eg. Oracle).
    - However, the ODBC provider has some issues with enhanced IDescribeSchema (see FDO trac #552). So a new preference is available to specify which providers should not use enhanced IDescribeSchema. By default, the ODBC provider is checked.
    - Expression Editor intellisense.
        - Auto-complete text:
            - single-quote
            - double-quote

v0.7.7
------

- Enhancements:
    - Re-implemented pre-0.6 missing features
        - When bulk copying from a source connection to a target connection and the target connection has no schemas defined, assumes all classes within are to be copied.
        - RunTask command for FdoUtil.exe
    - Support for Association and Object Properties in the Schema Editor
    - You can now run non-SELECT SQL queries in the Data Query View
    - Features that failed to be processed in an ETL task are now properly logged with exception details and a textual dump of that feature.

        - SDF, SHP and SQLite files
        - Feature Schema files
        - Saved Connection files
        - Bulk Copy Definitions

- Other:
    - Copy Spatial Context fixes for SQL Server 2008

    - Bulk copy fixes:
        - Now properly supports multi-class bulk copy
        - Can bulk copy computed expression properties
    - Invalid spatial context associations will be handled gracefully when a feature schema is loaded and applied (either set to the first spatial context or empty if no spatial contexts found)
    - Obfuscate protected properties in the connection tooltips. However this only obfuscates properties that FDO deems as protected. It will not obfuscate a password in a ODBC "ConnectinString" property for example.	

v0.7.5
------

- Enhancements:
    - Now uses FDO 3.4.0 final release.
    - CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) support. Be very careful with the Update and Delete functions. One false move and your data could be toast!
    - Bulk update support. Be VERY careful with this function! A false filter could cause irreversible changes to your data!
    - Bulk delete support. Be ESPECIALLY careful with this function! Words in all caps cannot emphasise the potential destruction wrought by this function!
    - Express support for SQL Server 2008 spatial.
    - Schema editor is now smarter in contextual mode. Will prevent you from adding most unsupported features.
    - Password properties are now properly masked in the Generic connect and create data store dialogs.

- Other:
    - ETL processes now gracefully continue on failed features.

    - Now a proper single-instance application. Subsequent attempts to launch a new process will instead re-focus the main application window.
    - Data Preview is now Data Query
    - Schema editor now reverts to using GeometricType instead of GeometryType, it will remain this way until FDO 3.5 enters beta.
    - RDBMS provider fixes for the Generic connect dialog.
    - Improved user documentation.
    - PostGIS express connect dialog now matches the MySQL one.

v0.7.1
------

- Enhancements:
    - Support for creating flat-file FDO data connections via drag and drop.
    - Add new "Copy Spatial Contexts" command, allowing you to copy spatial contexts from one connection to another.
    - Connection nodes in the Object Explorer now show all spatial contexts in tooltips
    - Improved bulk copy insert performance by using cached IInsert (and its PropertyValues) instead of FdoFeatureService.InsertFeature(). Performance gains are significant, for SQLite performance is *lightning* fast as opposed to dog-slow using the previous approach.
    - Add express module support for SQLite.
    - Add express connection support for the following providers: MySQL and PostGIS
    - Data Preview: Add SQLite output format.
    - Data Preview: Saved query results now have spatial context information included.

    - Refined Schema Editor. This one is more simpler and can also function as a standalone editor.
    - Application Console can now be saved/cleared.
    - Added a text editor component (used by SharpDevelop). It currently serves no real purpose and is disabled for now.
    - Added a Preference UI extension API. To register and expose your preference UIs, implement IPreferenceSheet 
      and specify the concrete type under the path "/FdoToolbox/Preferences" in your addin definition.
    - Express module now supports connecting to common ODBC formats (MS Access, Excel, SQL Server, Text files)
    - Express module now supports connecting to common OGR formats (currently: MapInfo, CSV and ESRI Personal Geodatabase)
    - Added ability to specify a configuration file for both generic and odbc express connection dialogs.
    - Revised ETL framework (based off Rhino ETL) is now fully implemented. All existing ETL functionality has been migrated over to this framework.

    - Nearly everything has been re-written from the ground up. 
    - Database/Non-spatial support has been dropped in favour of more specialized support for the ODBC provider.
    - Core API is now fully documented.

v0.6.0
------

- Enhancements:
    - Visual Preview of FDO data sources using the SharpMap library.
    - MapGuide Extension Module. This is experimental and work in progress.
    - Data Preview: You will be warned about potentially large query results sets being returned. If the number
      of results exceeds the preference value of PREF_INT_WARN_DATASET, you will get this warning.
    - When bulk copying, the schema to be applied is checked for compatibility. If it is not compatible with
      the target connection, the incompatibilities are displayed with the option to alter it to be compatible.
    
- Other:
    - Replaced MyMeta library with raw ADO.net for database introspection. As a result, there is a much
      improved performance gain when creating non-spatial connections.
    - SQL Server 2008 bulk copy overrides
    - FDO Toolbox application specific elements have been removed from FdoToolbox.Core.dll and are now residing in its own
      library - FdoToolbox.Base.dll
    - Added initial drop of a revised ETL API. This is an expermental API (still developing) and is not used by any FDO Toolbox classes. 
      Eventually the existing ETL infrastructure will be deprecated and replaced with the revised API.
    - CHM-based user documentation. Currently this is just a skeleton. More content will arrive in future releases.
    - CHM-based API documentation. This covers the FdoToolbox.Core.dll assembly and is automatically generated by NDoc

v0.5.8
------

- Enhancements:
    - Data Preview: Data Query results can be saved to SDF (only in standard mode at the moment)
    - New FGF binary -> text parser in fully managed code (used by Data Preview) and certain ETL tasks.
    - New ad-hoc data entry form for inserting new feature data into feature classes.
    - Bulk Copy: Source properties can now be mapped to most target properties regardless of data type. 
      This can naturally lead to data conversion errors as a result. These errors are logged during the bulk 
      copy process.
    - New Preference variable: pref_str_log_path
    - Bulk Copy: The source schema is now validated against the target to see if it can be applied as is.
    
- Fix:
    - Prevent creation of zero-length string, BLOB and CLOB data properties.
    - Added mandatory check for Data Property name.
    - Data Preview: Computed properties did not show.
    
v0.5.6
------

- Enhancements:
    - Data Preview: Lifted feature limit and make loading of preview data run from a background worker thread.

- Fixes:
    - Fixed incorrect totals for certain bulk copy tasks.
    - Fixed UI text in the Express Bulk Copy control.
    - Fixed potential crash in Generic Connect/Create Data Store controls for certain providers.

v0.5.5
------

- Enhancements:
    - New "Remove All" command for:
        - FDO connections
        - ADO.net connections
        - Tasks
    - Non-Spatial data support: Copy database tables to Point Feature Classes.
    - Tasks and connections are persisted and restored on each session.
    - Data Preview: Filtering support for Select Aggregates
    - Save/Load support for non-spatial connections
    - XML schemas for configuration files
    - Bulk Copy: Support for batched insertions. Insert performance is better under batched mode (upwards of 10x faster in Oracle!), but this is not supported by all providers.
    
- Other:
    - Object explorer menu updates
    - Data Preview: Grid pane now resides in a tab.
    - Added a unit test suite. Not all tests currently pass, as they are still being implemented and retrofitted. 
      Unit tests for the FDO API are *not* guaranteed to pass. Unit tests are only built in the debug configuration.

- Fixes:
    - Running tasks are now actually cancellable.
    - MySQL copy spatial context fixes.
    - Saving schema was saving with the schema name instead of the chosen file name.
    - Fixed incorrect property mapping in Bulk Copy Control.
    - Bulk Copy: Oracle-specific overrides
    - Bulk Copy: Improved counting process by avoiding the brute force approach if a faster alternative is available.
    - Bulk Copy: Fixed improper property/class mapping
    - Bulk Copy: If copying full schema, if any classes in it have no identity properties. An auto-generated property will be automatically created for it.

v0.5.0
------
- Enhancements:
    - Non-spatial data support.
        - Can create connections via OLEDB.
        - Can preview data via SQL.
        - Database Merge/Join Support.
            - Supported Join Types
                - Left Outer
                - Inner
            - Join Cardinalities
                - 1:1
                - 1:m
            - Please be aware of the following:
                - The target connection must support IApplySchema.
                - An auto-generated property will always be created on the target class
                - The FDO connection is always the "Left" side and the Database connection is always the "Right" side.
                - The target class is always created so it must not already exist.
                - A column prefix is required if there is a clash between property and column names. Validation will pick this up.
                - Properties which are also identity properties, can be copied over, but they won't be copied as identity properties to the joined feature class
    - New FdoUtil.exe commands: RegisterProvider and UnregisterProvider. Consult the updated cmd_readme.txt for details
    - FdoInfo.exe: Minor improvements in output display for ListClassProperties command.
    - New Preferences tab to edit preference dictionary values. Most preferences require an application restart to take effect.

- Other:
    - Major code/namespace re-structuring.
    
v0.4.2
------
- Enhancements:
    - General:
        - New per-class copy option: Delete before copy
            - Please be warned that deleting existing data may take a while. Only enable this option if necessary!
        - Added global spatial filter bulk copy option. This is a textual spatial filter that is applied to each feature class
          that is being copied
            - eg. INSIDE GeomFromText('POLYGON XY ((-124.07 49.1, -124.07 49.2, -123.8 49.2, -123.8 49.1, -124.07 49.1))')
            - To migrate existing bulk copy definitions. Add a <GlobalSpatialFilter> element at the end of the <BulkCopyOptions> element.
        - New command-line utility: FdoInfo.exe. Consult the updated cmd_readme.txt for usage instructions.
        - New command: Class Data Preview. This basically loads the Data Preview tab, set to the selected schema/class
        - Expression Editor now supports building Spatial and Distance operations.
        - Data Preview in standard query mode now has support for property lists and computed fields.
        
- Fixes:
    - Small changes to extent labels in Spatial Context Dialog
    - Clicking cancel on the Generic Connect/Create Data Store tabs will now close them.
    - Fixed incorrect spatial context envelope computation for certain data sources.
    - Fixed error about missing table: Projections in cscatalog.sqlite
    - Connection-bound tabs are now single-instance (per connection). For example: that means you can't open the Schema Management
      tab for <connection> more than once. Opening more than once will simply re-activate the existing tab.

- Other:
    - API name changes: Added a "Spatial" prefix to almost every class/property name starting with "Conn" as part of preparations for 
      non-spatial data support

v0.4.1
------
- Enhancements:
    - General:
        - Added new per-class bulk copy option: Attribute filter
            - To migrate existing bulk copy task definitions. Add a <SourceFilter> element as the last child of each <Mapping> element.
        - Merged all command-line utilites into a single utility, FdoUtil.exe. Consult the updated cmd_readme.txt for usage details.
        - Support for external FDO installations. When FdoToolbox launches for the first time it will look for the "FDO" subdirectory. 
          If this directory doesn't exist, you will be prompted to specify the directory containing the FDO binaries. After this the
          directory will be written to a string preference pref_str_fdo_home. This value will be written to preferences.xml and used 
          for every subsequent usage of FdoToolbox or its command-line utilities.
        - SchemaAttributeDictionary editing support for schemas and classes.
        - Added context menus for schema and class nodes on the Object Explorer. 
- Fixes:
    - Expression Editor:
        - When in filter mode, "Validate Expression" now uses Filter.Parse() instead of Expression.Parse()

- Other:
    - Removed lots of redundant code by introducing a FeatureService API

v0.4.0
------
- Enhancements:
    - General:
        - A whole suite of command-line utilites have been included. For more information see cmd_readme.txt
        - Coordinate System Catalog. You can store and manage commonly-used coordinate systems.
            - The Spatial Context Dialog can now invoke a Coordinate System picker to auto-fill parts of the form.
            
- Other:
    - API change in ICopySpatialContextOverride
    - Removed capability check for the manschema command as the tab it displays is already capability-aware.

v0.3.5
------
- Enhancements:
    - General:
        - New program: TaskRun.exe, use it to load and execute task definitions from the command line
            - Usage: TaskRun.exe [task definition file]
            - Please be aware that both source and target connections must be valid. Otherwise the execution will fail.
        - Capability-aware menus. If a menu item is disabled, it means you can't run that command on the current selected connection because that provider doesn't support it!
        - Data Store Manager for rdbms-based providers
        - Bulk copy enhancements.
            - Added source spatial context list to Bulk Copy Control, so the user can specify up-front which ones to copy.
            - Saved definitions can now be fully executed without manual user input, provided both source and target connections are valid.
        - Added Console Application framework. TaskRun.exe is built on this framework.
- Fixes:
    - Save dialogs now work as before
    - Data Preview: Be more lenient with the case of SQL queries.

SVN changesets: r130 - r144

v0.3.4
------

- Enhancements:
    - General:

        session. If Preferences.xml is not found then a default one will be created on application exit.
    - Spatial Contexts
        - Can now auto-compute the extents from a list of chosen classes.
    - Schema Management
        - Can save selected schema to:
            - XML
            - Applied to a new SDF file
        - Geometric Property Definition dialog now uses GeometryType allowing for more geometry types.
    - Express Module
        - You can now create connections straight after creating SDF/SHP files.
        - You can name your connection after creating a SDF/SHP connection
- Other:
    - Class editing is re-activated. Be aware that deleting properties won't work at the moment.
    - FDO libraries now reside in their own subdirectory. This makes it easier to update the FDO libraries independent of FDO Toolbox.
- Fixes:
    - Closing the main application window (via clicking the [X]) will now trigger application shutdown. 
    - Tabs now close if the connection they are bound to is also closed.
    - Tabs will be renamed if the connection they are bound to is also renamed.
    - Can un-hide Object Explorer or Application Console if they were accidentally hidden.
