# Windows Forms Project Skeleton

All projects of in the FDO Toolbox solution have been migrated over to the simplified
csproj format. A downside of this is that for projects that contains Windows Forms classes, Visual
Studio will not provide WinForms item templates for such projects.

As a workaround, this skeleton WinForms project is provided to create starting Form/Control classes
that can then be moved to your required project of choice.

## Usage

1. Add a Form or User Control to this project
2. Rename the class and its namespaces as required
3. Move the classes into the desired FdoToolbox project
