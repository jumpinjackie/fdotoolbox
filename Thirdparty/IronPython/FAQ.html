<h2>IronPython 2.0.3 Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h4>Q: Is this license OSI compliant?</h4>
<p>A: Absolutely. The Microsoft Public License has been approved by OSI.</p>
<h4>Q: What copyright rights does the license grant me?</h4>
<p>A: The license grants you a copyright license to make unlimited copies of the 
Software in source or object code form, as well as to create Derivative Works (as 
that term is defined under US copyright law). This means that in addition to making 
unlimited copies of the Software, you have a copyright license to modify the Software 
and to use all or part of the Software to create a Derivative Work.</p>
<h4>Q: What patent rights does the license grant me?</h4>
A: This license grants you a patent license to use and distribute the Software under 
any Microsoft patent claims that read on the Software itself. In other words, if 
you create a modified version of the Software, you still retain the patent license 
to use and distribute the original portions of the Software under the specific Microsoft 
patent claims that read on the Software, but you do not have a patent license as 
to the new functionality you may have added by modifying the Software. This result 
is typical of many common open source licenses, including the Common Public License 
(CPL) and the Mozilla Public License (MPL). In addition, this license grants no 
rights to any Microsoft patents that read on other components or files not included 
in the Software. This means that no patent license is granted to use or distribute 
any other software or technology that may be needed to use the Software or was created 
from the Software (for example, any compiled output of the Software, the combination 
of the Software with other hardware or other software, or any additional enabling 
technologies that may be necessary to make or use the Software or any final product 
that includes the Software).

<h2>Technical Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Q: How do I report a bug or get help?</h3>
<p>A: On <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ironpython">CodePlex</a> you can file 
bugs by selecting the &quot;Issue Tracker&quot; tab and clicking on &quot;New Work Item&quot;.&nbsp; 
On the home page you'll see a link to join our mailing list.</p>
<h3>Q: Is there Visual Studio integration for completion, coloring, WinForms 
designer, etc.?</h3>
<p>A good explanation of the Visual Studio IronPython integration sample is in
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/aaronmar/archive/2006/02/16/533273.aspx">this 
blog post</a>.</p>
<h3>Q: Why do you require .NET 2.0 to run IronPython 2.0.3?</h3>
A: There are a lot of features in .NET 2.0 that we wanted to use in IronPython. 
These include generics, DynamicMethods, new kinds of delegates, and more. We could 
have supported these new features using #ifdefs to keep a version of the code base 
that ran on 1.1. We decided that backwards compatibility wasn&rsquo;t worth complicating 
the code base and development of IronPython at this time. We expect that when we 
start working on adding support for new .NET 3.0 features to IronPython that we&rsquo;ll 
do them in the #ifdef or similar way so that IronPython will continue to run on 
.NET 2.0 for the foreseeable future.<br>
<h3>Q: Why does IronPython not follow the standard C# naming conventions, why so 
many FxCop errors?</h3>
A: We have fixed all FxCop errors in the IronPython.Hosting namespace which is 
the main public API exposed by IronPython.&nbsp; However, there are other public 
types that are marked public either because the generated IL code needs them or 
because of historical reasons.&nbsp; While we would like to fix all FxCop issues 
for all public types, those remaining do not affect users of IronPython.&nbsp; 
We want to release IronPython 2.0.3 under the principles of &nbsp;"release early, 
release often".&nbsp; We thought that it was unnecessary to delay the release to 
take the time to do this work first.&nbsp; These kinds of issues will be 
resolved as we work on future releases.<h3>Q: Why am I getting errors when trying to use WinForms?</h3>
<p>A: One common error that you may be getting is:</p>
<blockquote>
	<pre>C:\IronPython&gt;ipy.exe
IronPython 1.0.2424 on .NET 2.0.50727.42
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import System.Windows.Forms as WinForms
Traceback (most recent call last):
File , line 0, in -toplevel-
AttributeError: 'package#' object has no attribute 'Windows'</pre>
</blockquote>
<pre></pre>
<p>The cause is that IronPython needs help finding any assemblies that are even 
a little bit out of the ordinary.&nbsp; The Built-in module clr provides functions to add 
references to .NET modules (clr.AddReference).&nbsp; For more information, see the
<a href="Tutorial/Tutorial.htm#T1.3">Loading .NET Libraries</a> exercise in the
<a href="Tutorial/Tutorial.htm">IronPython Tutorial</a> (if you're reading the 
FAQ on the web, the tutorial.htm document is in the tutorial directory where you 
installed IronPython).</p>

<h3>Q: How do I make use of .NET features in IronPython?</h3>
<p>A: Users have to opt in to this functionality.&nbsp; No new keywords have 
been added, and the existing language semantics are unchanged.&nbsp; A "clr" 
module is available for import to turn on .NET extensions. See the
<a href="Tutorial/Tutorial.htm">IronPython Tutorial</a> for good examples (if 
you're reading the FAQ on the web, the tutorial.htm document is in the tutorial 
directory where you installed IronPython).&nbsp; 
Using the "import clr" statement adds methods to built-in types in some cases; 
for example, dir(int) will show a ToString attribute.&nbsp; Such effects only 
happen in the context of the module that contains the "import clr" statement.</p>
<h3>Q: How do I import .NET namespaces from assemblies other than System and 
Mscorlib?</h3>
<p>A: IronPython can directly import only some of the .NET libraries -- the most 
commonly used ones.&nbsp; To use additional .NET assemblies, they must be 
explicitly referenced.&nbsp; To add a reference to a .NET assembly, use one of 
the clr.AddReference* functions.&nbsp; See
<a href="Tutorial/Tutorial.htm">IronPython Tutorial</a> for good examples and 
instruction on how to do this (if you're reading the FAQ on the web, the 
tutorial.htm document is in the tutorial directory where you installed 
IronPython).</p>
<h3>Q: How do I use CPython standard libraries?</h3>
<p>A: To tell IronPython where the Python standard library is, you can add the 
&quot;lib&quot; directory of CPython to IronPython's path.&nbsp; To do this, put the 
following code into IronPython's &quot;site.py&quot; file (replace c:\python24\lib with 
your actual path to the CPython lib directory): </p>
<blockquote>
	<pre>import sys
sys.path.append(r&quot;c:\python24\lib&quot;)

</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Q: Why are some built-in modules not present?</h3>
<p>A: IronPython implements all the commonly used built-in modules.&nbsp; Some 
modules are not implemented because they are OS-specific (for example, they are 
only relevant on SGI or the Mac).&nbsp; Some modules aren't present only because 
we didn't have time to implement them yet.&nbsp;&nbsp; See the
<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython&title=Differences">IronPython Differences</a> document for details. </p>
<h3>Q: What CPython version are you compatible with?</h3>
<p>A: IronPython 2.0.3 targeted CPython 2.5 for compatibility.&nbsp; See the
<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython&title=Differences">IronPython Differences</a> document for details.</p>
<h3>Q: Do you have any 2.5 features working?</h3>
<p>A: Yes, IronPython implements several 2.5 features: all(), any(), max() with 
a key argument, min() with a key argument, partition() and rpartition() on 
strings, the with statement, empty parenthetic expression for the bases classes 
in a class statement, try-except-finally, and ternary expressions</p>
<h3>Q: Do we work with the .NET Compact Framework?</h3>
<p>A: No, IronPython 2.0.3 targets only the .NET 2.0 Common Language Runtime.&nbsp; 
The .NET Compact Framework lacks Reflection.Emit and lightweight code generation 
(dynamic methods), both of which IronPython requires.</p>
<h3>Q: How do I compile .py files to a DLL for linking into my C# or VB program?</h3>
<p>A: IronPython does not support building DLLs for a C# style of linking and 
calling into Python code.&nbsp; You can define interfaces in C#, build those 
into a DLL, and then implement those interfaces in Python code as well as pass the 
python objects that 
implement the interfaces to C# code.</p>
<h3>Q: How do I build and call into PYD libraries?</h3>
<p>A: IronPython does not support using PYDs built for CPython since they 
leverage implementation details of CPython.&nbsp; You can get a similar effect 
for new &quot;PYD&quot;s you would like to implement by writing them in C# or VB and 
building a DLL for .NET.</p>
<h3>Q: How do I create, or why don't you create .pyc files?</h3>
<p>A: IronPython does not cache binary products for .py files, nor write fast 
loading version of .py files.&nbsp; IronPython will likely support this kind of 
optimization in the future.</p>

<h3>Q: How do I choose amongst a method's overloads?</h3>
<p>A: .NET methods may have an Overloads attribute which can be indexed by a 
tuple of types to choose between overloads of a .NET method.&nbsp; For example, 
the following chooses the WriteLine method that takes an object and passes None 
for it:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New"><font size="2">from System import Console<br>
	Console.WriteLine.Overloads[object](None)</font></font></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Q: How can I call a method with <span style="font-weight: 400">
<font face="Courier New">ref</font></span>, <span style="font-weight: 400">
<font face="Courier New">out</font></span>, and <span style="font-weight: 400">
<font face="Courier New">params</font></span> parameters?</h3>
<p>A: Consider the following C# class which defines methods with ref, out, and 
params parameters. Following the C# code are examples in the Python interpreter 
of calling these methods.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">File a.cs (compiled with &quot;csc.exe /t:library 
	a.cs&quot;):</font></p>
	<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">public class C {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static int MethodRef(ref int i) { i = 1; return 2; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static int MethodOut(out int i) { i = 1; return 2; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static int MethodParams(params object[] values) { 
	return values.Length; }<br>}</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Loading the class C:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">&gt;&gt;&gt; import clr<br>
	&gt;&gt;&gt; clr.AddReference(&quot;a.dll&quot;)<br>
	&gt;&gt;&gt; import C</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Calling the method with ref parameters: if you pass the value (3) directly, 
the output value will become part of the returned tuple.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">&gt;&gt;&gt; C.MethodRef(3)<br>(2, 1)</font></p>
</blockquote>
	
	<p>Alternatively, you can create an instance of clr.Reference&lt;T&gt; and 
	initialize it with the value that you want to pass into the method. When the 
	call returns, the value will have been updated.</p>
	<blockquote>
	<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">&gt;&gt;&gt; import clr<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = clr.Reference[int](3)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; x.Value<br>3<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; C.MethodRef(x)<br>2<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; x.Value<br>1</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Calling the method with an out parameter is very similar, except there is no 
need to provide the input value. The values of the out parameters will become 
part of the returned tuple:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">&gt;&gt;&gt; C.MethodOut()<br>(2, 1)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also provide an instance of clr.Reference&lt;T&gt; to capture the value of 
the out parameter. The initial value in this case does not matter.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">&gt;&gt;&gt; x = clr.Reference[int]()<br>
	&gt;&gt;&gt; x.Value&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	# The Value is initialized to 0<br>
	0<br>
	&gt;&gt;&gt; C.MethodOut(x)<br>2<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; x.Value&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	# Value was modified by the MethodOut method.<br>1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; x.Value = 10<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; C.MethodOut(x)<br>2<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; x.Value<br>1</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>IronPython handles methods with params arguments in a natural way. The 
parameters can be passed as a parameter list:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">&gt;&gt;&gt; C.MethodParams(1,2,3)<br>3<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; C.MethodParams(1,2,3,4,5,6,)<br>6</font></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Q: How do I create a .NET array?</h3>
<p>A: Here is an example that shows how to create a .NET array: 
"System.Array[int]((1,2,3))".</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New"><font size="2">import System<br>
	System.Array[int]((1,2,3))</font></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is another example that creates a multi-dimensional array of arrays and 
initializes it (any kind of Python sequence can be used to initialize the 
array):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Array[Array[int]]( ( (1,2), (2,3) ) )</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to create a true 
multi-dimensional array and set elements, you can do the following :</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">x = Array.CreateInstance(int, Array[int]((1,2,3)))<br>
x[0,1,2] = 2</font></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Q: How do I specify generic types, such as collections?</h3>
<p>A: IronPython supports an indexing-like syntax for identifying concrete 
realizations of generic types and methods, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">import System<br>
q = System.Collections.Generic.Queue[str]()</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is similar to creating a .NET 
array.</p>
<h3>Q: How can I access .NET properties and indexers?</h3>
<p>A: The following is a simple example of setting and getting the value of a 
property &quot;Text&quot; on a windows form. The syntax is the same as any attribute 
access.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">&gt;&gt;&gt; import System<br>
	&gt;&gt;&gt; clr.AddReference(&quot;System.Windows.Forms&quot;)<br>
	&gt;&gt;&gt; from System.Windows.Forms import Form<br>
	&gt;&gt;&gt; f = Form()<br>
	&gt;&gt;&gt; f.Text = &quot;Hello&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	# Set the property<br>
	&gt;&gt;&gt; f.Text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	# Get the property value<br>
	'Hello'<br>
	&gt;&gt;&gt;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To call indexers, use Python's indexing syntax:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">&gt;&gt;&gt; import System<br>
	&gt;&gt;&gt; h = System.Collections.Hashtable()<br>
	&gt;&gt;&gt; h['a'] = 10<br>
	&gt;&gt;&gt; h['a']<br>
	10</font></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Q: How does IronPython handle conversions between Python types and .NET 
types?</h3>
<p>A: IronPython runs on the .NET Framework which provides more primitive types 
than Python. If you use normal Python code with IronPython, you will only 
encounter the standard Python types (int, long, float, str, ...). When calling 
.NET methods, IronPython will try to convert the argument values to the 
appropriate .NET types. See below for an example with integer numbers.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">File a.cs (compiled with &quot;csc.exe /t:library 
	a.cs&quot;):</font></p>
	<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">public class C {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static void MethodUShort(ushort p) { }<br>
	}</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following Python code calls the &quot;MethodUShort&quot; on class C with different 
argument values:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">&gt;&gt;&gt; import clr<br>
	&gt;&gt;&gt; clr.AddReference(&quot;a.dll&quot;)<br>
	&gt;&gt;&gt; import C<br>
	&gt;&gt;&gt; C.MethodUShort(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	# conversion will succeed<br>
	&gt;&gt;&gt; C.MethodUShort(65536)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	# 65536 won't fit into System.UInt16<br>
	Traceback (most recent call last):<br>
	File , line 0, in &lt;stdin&gt;##20<br>
	File , line 0, in MethodUShort##19<br>
	OverflowError: Arithmetic operation resulted in an overflow.<br>
	&gt;&gt;&gt; C.MethodUShort(-1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	# neither will -1<br>
	Traceback (most recent call last):<br>
	File , line 0, in &lt;stdin&gt;##21<br>
	File , line 0, in MethodUShort##19<br>
	OverflowError: Arithmetic operation resulted in an overflow.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Q: How does IronPython work with the .NET System.Char type since Python 
doesn't have a char type?</h3>
<p>A: In IronPython, all strings of length 1 will be automatically coerced into 
System.Char type when System.Char type is expected. If a method returns 
System.Char type, the actual return value will be an instance of System.Char 
type, but the value can be easily converted to string:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">&gt;&gt;&gt; x = System.Char.Parse('a')<br>
	&gt;&gt;&gt; x<br>
	&lt;System.Char object at 0x000000000000002C [a]&gt;<br>
	&gt;&gt;&gt; str(x)<br>
	'a'</font></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Q: How does IronPython work with .NET structs, value types, enums?</h3>
<p>A: All instances of value types are always boxed within the IronPython 
runtime. For more details, refer to the
<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython&title=Value Types">
document</a> on CodePlex.</p>
<h3>Q: How do .NET assemblies and namespaces relate to Python modules?</h3>
<p>A: In IronPython, the import mechanism provides access to the namespaces in 
.NET assemblies. Once the assembly is referenced by the IronPython runtime, it is possible to 
import the namespaces contained within the assembly. Once a namespace is 
imported, all nested namespaces are also accessible.&nbsp; For more information, 
see the
<a href="Tutorial/Tutorial.htm#T1.3">Loading .NET Libraries</a> exercise in the
<a href="Tutorial/Tutorial.htm">IronPython Tutorial</a> (if you're reading the 
FAQ on the web, the tutorial.htm document is in the tutorial directory where you 
installed IronPython).</p>
<blockquote>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New">&gt;&gt;&gt; import System<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; clr.AddReference(&quot;System.Windows.Forms&quot;)<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; import System.Windows<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; form = System.Windows.Forms.Form()</font>
</blockquote>
<h3>Q: How does IronPython's threading model relate to CPython's with respect to 
object operations?</h3>
<p>A: CPython has a Global Interpreter Lock, and it interprets opcodes for 
operations on primitive types atomically.&nbsp; IronPython also ensures 
operations on primitive types are atomic (for example, inserting into a list or 
removing an item at a specific index).&nbsp; However, IronPython's in-place 
addition operations (for example, &quot;l = []; l += [2,3,4]&quot;) are not atomic, so if 
two threads perform this operation, &quot;l&quot; could end up with interleaving values.&nbsp; 
Furthermore, IronPython looks up an operation's implementation method atomically 
and then invokes the method atomically.&nbsp; Between the time of the look up 
and the invoke, another thread could execute that replaced the definition of the 
operation, and the first thread would invoke the old definition it found. If a 
program's behavior needs to be guaranteed across this sort of scenario, your 
program should be ensuring this level of thread safety; the CPython 
specification makes no guarantees in this situation either.</p>
<h3>Q: Why does ipy.exe appear to access the internet sometimes?</h3>
<p>A: Microsoft signs its DLLs so that they can be verified as coming from 
Microsoft.&nbsp; Because ipy.exe is using DLLs that are signed, the .NET CLR tries 
to confirm the certificates that were used to sign the DLLs.&nbsp; 
When it does this, you may notice internet traffic to a certification service 
for signed binaries, and you may notice performance impact on start up.&nbsp;
