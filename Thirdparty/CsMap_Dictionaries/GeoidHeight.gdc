#
# The first several files listed here, those
# with the .bin extension, are Geoid99 files.
# Usually, these are the desired files.  You can,
# of course, comment these lines out and use the
# Geoid96 files, which are commented out below.
#
# Note, if the file is listed here, it is expected
# to be found, otherwise a fatal error occurs.
#
# Note also that the Geoid99 files are quite large.
# Therefore, under normal circumstances, we use the
# default buffer size, which is 3 times the size of
# a record in the file.

# Since Geoid 99 is now thw preferred source for
# Geoid Heights, the following are commented out.
# There really isn't much difference between the
# the two.  But you "pays your money, and you
# takes your choice."

# You can also add Canadian files, but be sure to
# include the .byn extension.
#
#.\Canada\Geoid\HT2_0.byn
#
# You can also use the gsss99.bin files, the
# MEXICAN97.geo files, etc.  Just keep the
# extension on the file.  Also, note that in the
# case of geographic overlap, the file which
# is listed first will take precedence.
#
# WW15MGH.GRD contains geoid heights for the entire
# earth in a 15 minute grid format.  You can activate
# that file as well.  Be sure to retain the .GRD extension
# .\WW15MGH.GRD
