# Vertical Conversion
#
# Each line points to a datum shift data file.  In the case of
# overlapping coverage, the program selects the data file with
# the smallest grid cell in the region of the conversion.  If
# the grid cell sizes are the same, the program selects the
# file which appears first in this file.
#
# Order the list of files as appropriate for your application.
# You can add additional files as they become available.  While
# the name, letter case, and location of the file name is not
# important, the extension must be ".gsb" if the file is in
# the Canadian National Transformation, Version 2 format.  Each
# line may be a full path name.  The ".\" sequence used here is
# a relative folder/directory reference, relative to the folder
# (directory) in which this file resides.

#
# The fallback feature has not been implemented for vertical
# datums.  Outside the coverage of the above files, there are
# no official conversion techniques known to the authors.
