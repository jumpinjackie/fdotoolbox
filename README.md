A multi-purpose tool for working with geospatial data.

FDO Toolbox is an multi-purpose geospatial tool to create, analyse, convert, process and manage spatial data. It is written in C# and uses the Feature Data Objects (FDO) API (http://fdo.osgeo.org)

Depending on the version of FDO Toolbox you have, you will need the following components installed as well:

 * 1.4 (current): .net Framework 4.8, Visual C++ 2015 runtime (included with installer)
 * 1.3: .net Framework 4.5, Visual C++ 2012 runtime
 * 1.0-1.2: .net Framework 4.0, Visual C++ 2010 runtime
 * older: .net Framework 2.0 SP1, Visual C++ 2008 runtime

FDO Toolbox was previously hosted on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/fdotoolbox/)

Disclaimer: Know what you are doing before trying this on production-quality geospatial data.
