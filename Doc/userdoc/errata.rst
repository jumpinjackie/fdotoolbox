====================

This section includes a high-level summary of changes to the documentation for this release of FDO Toolbox

v1.5.0
------

 * Updated command line code list

v1.4.0
------

 * Removed ``Configuration`` section as this release de-emphasizes customisability of FDO Toolbox
 * Removed ``Custom Operations`` section in ``Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations`` line with de-emphasizing customisability of FDO Toolbox and also because these operations do not have a corresponding UI element.
